# Procedural Content Generation (PCG)

The Procedural Content Generation Framework (PCG) is a toolset for creating your own procedural content inside Unreal Engine. 
PCG allows artists and designers to build fast, iterative tools and content of any complexity ranging from asset utilities, such as buildings or biome generation, up to entire worlds.

The PCG framework is built for extensibility and interactivity, providing easy integration into existing world-building pipelines, and effectively blurring the lines between procedural and more traditional workflows.

> [!Warning]
> The Procedural Content Generation Framework requires the "**Procedural Content Generation Framework plugin**" to be enabled in your project.

> [!Note]
> The Procedural Content Generation Framework Geometry Script Interop plugin is required to sample points on Static Meshes.
